Before the Revolutionary War, the colonists were getting mad at the British. The British had been taxing them, and they were taking it out on the tax collectors. <!--more-->Soon, the British stationed soldiers by the tax collectors. The Boston Massacre was a confrontation between British soldiers and colonists.

On that night, a crowd grew. The colonists started throwing rocks at the soldiers. The soldiers shot back, and killed 5 colonists. The soldiers were tried, but only one was found guilty (of manslaughter).
