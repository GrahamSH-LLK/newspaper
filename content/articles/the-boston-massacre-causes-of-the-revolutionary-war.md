Before the Revolutionary War, the colonists were getting mad at the British because they had been taxing them. The colonists were taking it out on the tax collectors. <!--more-->Soon, the British stationed soldiers by the tax collectors to protect them. The Boston Massacre was a specific confrontation between these British soldiers and colonists.

On that night, a crowd grew. The colonists started throwing rocks at the soldiers. The soldiers shot back, and killed 5 colonists. The soldiers were tried, but only one was found guilty (of manslaughter). The rest went free.

Later, Paul Revere created a piece of propaganda (an etching). The etching was misleading and made it seem that the British were much worse than they were. For example, in the propaganda, the British were still shooting after killing 5 people. This etching got the public mad, which directly led to the war starting.
