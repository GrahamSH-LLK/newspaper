Before the Revolutionary War, the colonists were 
frustrated with the British tax system. The colonists directed their frustrations at the British tax collectors. <!--more-->In response, the British stationed soldiers with the tax collectors to protect them. The Boston Massacre was a specific confrontation between these British soldiers and colonists.

On March 5th, 1770, a mob gathered to taunt the British soldiers. The colonists threw rocks at the soldiers. The soldiers shot back, and killed 5 colonists. The soldiers were tried in court, but only one was found guilty of manslaughter. The rest went free. The colonists felt strongly that justice was not served.

Later, Paul Revere created an etching that served as an important  piece of propaganda. The etching was misleading and made it seem that the British were much worse than they were. For example, in the propaganda, the British were still shooting after killing 5 people. This etching made the public angry, which contributed to the Revolutionary War.
