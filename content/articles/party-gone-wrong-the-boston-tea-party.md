Long ago, the colonists were upset with the Tea Act, so they decided to revolt against the British. Their idea was to sneak on the British tea ships and dump all the tea into the ocean. They dressed as Native Americans, since they were scared and weren't sure what they were doing.

Afterward, the Colonists used the response of the British as a rallying cry. This helped to convince the rest of the colonists that the time to fight back against the British had come. This convinced more people go to war with the British.
