The Articles of Confederation were the first form of government after the Colonies won the war. They were very flawed and were quickly overturned. We broke it down into 3 parts that you might not have heard of.

### Part One

> [D]elegates will have freedom of speech and they are protected from being arrested or punished for any crimes they commit.
This, Article 5, makes the delegates above the law, which is one of the things that the Declaration of Independence complained about.

### Part Two
> The states enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, the security of liberties, and their mutual welfare.
The third article states must not be hostile to each other. This helps the new US stay united and strong.

### Part Three
> No vessels of war shall be kept in any of the states at any time.
Article number 6 keeps the US from having a national army. This kept the states from being defended, and since other states didn't have to help each other, rebellions like Shays' rebellion could last for a long time.


Overall, the Articles were somewhat good but mostly bad for the fledgling US.
