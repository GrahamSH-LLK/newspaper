The Articles of Confederation were the first form of government after the Colonies won the war. They were very flawed and were quickly overturned. Below, we highlight three important elements from these articles.

### Part One

> [D]elegates will have freedom of speech and they are protected from being arrested or punished for any crimes they commit.
Article 5 makes the delegates above the law. This was one of the concerns raised in the Declaration of Independence.

### Part Two
> The states enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense, the security of liberties, and their mutual welfare.
The third article emphasizes that states must not be hostile to each other. This helped the new US stay united and strong.

### Part Three
> No vessels of war shall be kept in any of the states at any time.
Article Six barred the US from having a national army. This kept the states from defending one another, or from any other nations. The states didn't have to help each other, making it more difficult to stop rebellions like Shays' rebellion.


Overall, the Articles were somewhat helpful at establishing an initial government, but they fell fall short of the needs of the fledgling US.
