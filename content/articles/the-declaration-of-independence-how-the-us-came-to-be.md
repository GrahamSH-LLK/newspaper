The Declaration of Independence is a long and confusing document that can be hard to understand. We broke it down into four easy-to-understand sections.

## Section 1
The first section of the Declaration tells us that sometimes people have to cut ties with another group. When this happens, they must declare this to the world. This sets the declaration up to explain why the colonies must break off from the British. According to this section, “When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary to one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another.” This is telling us that sometimes countries have to split off from other countries, and this is what the colonies must do. 

## Section 2

This section tells the reader that people should have certain rights, and when they are abused repeatedly by a government, they should make a new government. It states that 
> [A]ll men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”
All people should have these rights, no matter the government. These rights should not be taken away.

## Section 3

Section 3 explains that the British have had many offenses against the colonists, from removing legislation to killing colonists. The section says that “A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.” They are saying that the king has been an unfair tyrant to the colonists, so he is unfit to be their king anymore.

## Section 4

The last section, Section 4 explains that the colonists should, and will break away from the British. According to the text, 
> [T]hese United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States.” They are saying that the colonies will, and have to be free from the British.
