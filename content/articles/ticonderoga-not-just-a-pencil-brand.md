The colonists were in need of cannons and ammunition to fight the British. The colonists decided to attack Fort Ticonderoga to steal its resources. They quickly overpowered the soldiers. To do this, they first attacked the leader. They seized the fort, and got many cannons. This also gave them a strategic planning position.

This fort gave them many cannons, which helped them defeat the British. Now they had many, many more cannons to attack the British. With more power, they could attack the British more effectively. In addition, the strategic planning position let them plan ahead for new attacks.
