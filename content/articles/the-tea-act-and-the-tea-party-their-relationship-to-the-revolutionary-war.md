After many taxes to the colonists, the British added a new one. This tax, called the Tea Act, made tea cheaper, but it still added a tax. This made the colonists angry because they had been told that they wouldn’t be taxed. In addition to this, they cut out the merchants, which also made some colonists mad. Since they were angry, some colonists planned the Tea Party. They dressed up as Native Americans and snuck onto the British ships. Then, they threw all the tea into the water.


In response to the Tea Party, the British created the Intolerable Acts. These consisted of four acts. One closed the port of Boston, which cut off trade and made the Bostonians entirely reliant on the British for news and supplies. Another eliminated the colonial government, so the colonists had no control or representation in their legislation. The next made it so that British officials would have their trial in Britain. These "trials" would often be unfair, so the British officials would effectively become above the law. The last act made it so that British soldiers were allowed to stay in people’s homes. People couldn't say no, and these soldiers used up their resources like food. These acts were the final straw for the colonists, and they started the Revolutionary War soon after.
