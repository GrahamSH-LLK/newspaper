# What happened?

Shays’ Rebellion was a rebellion led by Daniel Shays. He wanted the Massachusetts government to stop unfairly taxing farmers based on their land. Farmers were quite hurt by this because they had lost many of their crops during the Revolutionary war. Since Shays had been a farmer, he had empathy for them.

# Who is to blame?

The Revolutionary War was the most to blame for this rebellion. It caused the debt, which caused the taxes. This was one of the main reasons Shays was mad. In addition to these taxes, the war also ruined the crops. This made the farmers even worse off.

# Was it all that bad?
> This is a medicine to help make sure a government stays healthy.
Thomas Jefferson is saying that the rebellion is helping the country. It showed and tried to overturn a possibly bad government. Eventually, this caused changes that make the US a better place with a better government.
