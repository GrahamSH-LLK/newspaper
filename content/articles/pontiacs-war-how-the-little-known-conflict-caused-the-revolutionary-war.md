Pontiac’s War was a war between the Colonists and British, and the Native Americans. The colonists wanted to live in the Ohio River valley after winning the French and Indian war. However, the Native Americans led by Pontiac didn’t want the colonists to live in their territory, since it was their home. They attacked the colonists. The colonists couldn’t hold off the Native Americans, so they got help from the British. At first, the British didn't want to help (since they were already in debt from the French and Indian war) and suggested giving the Native Americans blankets infected with smallpox in order to kill the Native Americans. Soon though, the British agreed to help the colonists, and ended up fighting Pontiac's army. After this, the British were in huge debt.

Since the British were in debt, they created the Proclamation of 1763. The proclamation kept the colonists from going across an imaginary line into the Ohio River Valley. Since the colonists had helped the British win the French and Indian war, they were outraged.
