Pontiac’s War was a war where the Colonists and British were united against the Native Americans. The colonists wanted to live in the Ohio River Valley after winning the French and Indian war. However, the Native Americans, led by Pontiac, didn’t want the colonists to live in their territory. This was their home. The  Native Americans attacked the colonists. The colonists couldn’t hold off the Native Americans, so they got help from the British. At first, the British didn't want to help (since they were already in debt from the French and Indian war) and suggested giving the Native Americans blankets infected with smallpox. Ultimately, the British agreed to help the colonists, and fought Pontiac's army. After this, the British were in huge debt.

The British war debt led to the Proclamation of 1763. The British were unwilling to engage in another expensive conflict. The proclamation kept the colonists from crossing an imaginary line into the Ohio River Valley. Since the colonists had helped the British win the French and Indian war, they were outraged.
