title: 'Third Timeâ€™s the Charm - For the British At Least'
---
Bunker Hill was a battle between the British and the Colonists. The colonists were trying to keep the British from climbing Bunker Hill. The British attacked 3 times. The British's first attack failed, with the colonists holding the British off. The second attack got a little farther, but it still eventually. Finally, the British's third push succeeded. The colonists couldn't hold them off because the colonists ran out of ammunition. 

This helped the colonists in many ways. For one, it gave them a confidence boost, since they had almost defeated the strong British. This also gave them the strategy of trenches. It also let them build on the experience and learn how they could defeat the British.
