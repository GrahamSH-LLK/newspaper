Bunker Hill was a battle between the British and the Colonists in the early days of the Revolutionary War. The colonists learned that the British were planning to take over the hills surrounding the city of Boston. The colonists attempted to keep the British from taking Bunker Hill. The British attacked three times. The first British attack failed, with the colonists holding the British off. The second attack got a little farther, but the colonists prevailed again. The third British attack succeeded. The colonists couldn't hold them off because they ran out of ammunition. 

The Battle of Bunker Hill helped the colonists in many ways. It gave them a confidence boost, since they had almost defeated the strong British army. It also taught them the strategy of using trenches. Digging trenches helped them limit casualties in this battle and in future battles. It allowed them to build on the experience and learn how they could defeat the British.
